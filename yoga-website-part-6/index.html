                        Here's how to do Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II) in five steps:

                        <br>1. Starting Position: Begin by standing at the top of your mat with your feet about 3 to 4 feet apart. Turn your right foot out to the side, so your toes point to the top edge of the mat. Keep your left foot turned slightly inward.

                        <br>2. Extend Your Arms: Raise both arms out to the sides at shoulder height, keeping them parallel to the floor. Your palms should face down, and your arms should be in line with your shoulders.

                        <br>3. Bend Your Right Knee: As you exhale, bend your right knee, bringing it directly over your right ankle. Make sure your knee is aligned with your second toe to protect the knee joint.

                        <br>4. Gaze Over Your Right Hand: Turn your head to look over your right fingertips. Your gaze should be forward, and your neck should be relaxed.

                        <br>5. Hold the Pose: Hold Warrior II for several breaths, keeping your upper body strong and engaged while sinking into the lunge of your right leg. Keep your hips and shoulders facing the side of the mat.

                        Here's how to do Corpse Pose (Savasana) in five steps:

                        <br>1. Starting Position: Lie flat on your back on a yoga mat or comfortable surface. Extend your legs straight out and let your feet fall open naturally. Place your arms alongside your body, palms facing up, and slightly away from your torso.
                        
                        <br>2. Relax Your Body: Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to settle into the pose. Allow your entire body to relax and release any tension. Soften your facial muscles, relax your jaw, and let go of any gripping in your hands or feet.
                        
                        <br>3. Scan Your Body: Mentally scan your body from head to toe, bringing awareness to different parts of your body. With each exhalation, consciously release any tension you might feel in those areas.
                        
                        <br>4. Breathe Deeply: Allow your breath to be natural and effortless. As you breathe, feel your abdomen rise and fall with each inhale and exhale. Focus on your breath and let go of any distracting thoughts.
                        
                        <br>5. Stay in Savasana: Remain in Corpse Pose for at least a few minutes, or as long as you like. This is a time of complete relaxation and stillness. If you wish to come out of the pose, gently deepen your breath, wiggle your fingers and toes, and slowly roll to one side, resting in a fetal position for a moment before slowly coming up to a seated position.
